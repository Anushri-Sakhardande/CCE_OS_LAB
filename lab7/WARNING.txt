1. These codes kinda half ChatGPT(for the threads part) and the other half partly understood for notes.
2. There is a semaphore library but idk if we were supposed to use that it sexily gives the initialization,signal and wait
3. These kinda are in an infinite loop because of how it was described in the manual
4. That being said it's really annoying so I've had to do the thread sleep so I can actually see the output
5. Had to include an extra function for philosophers
